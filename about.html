                Hi, I'm Muiz. I'm a multi-talented human with over 2+ years of
                experiences in Frontend development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a strong technical background in HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript as a frontend developer, and I have experience with
                well-known frameworks like React and Bootstrap. My emphasis on
                user-centered design guarantees that interfaces are clear and
                attractive, and my aptitude for problem-solving enables
                effective issue resolution. I speak well, work well in
                collaborative team settings, and rapidly learn new tasks. In
                addition, I successfully manage projects while keeping up with
                business trends and exhibiting a dedication to lifelong
                learning. I can design excellent, user-friendly web interfaces
                that satisfy the needs of both users and stakeholders thanks to
                my talents and experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The work I've done doesn't always define who I am. My career
                goals serve as my definition of who I am. Personality is innate,
                but skills may be taught. Continue learning, pushing oneself,
                and engaging in worthwhile and fascinating activities are what I
                like to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                My passion and energy never cease, which makes me easily
                motivated and willing to pursue my hobbies wherever they may
                lead. I'm a gifted, outgoing, and energetic individual with a
                talent for making others laugh and feel inspired. For me, simply
                coming up with ideas is never sufficient. Instead, I have a
                near-compulsive need to do action. I have a lot of energy and
                desire to pursue
              </p>
